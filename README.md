# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This is my first JavaScript projectâ€”a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the terminal.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and user interaction through the terminal.
- **Node.js**: (if applicable) For running the game in the terminal environment.

## Key Features
- **Code Structure**: Built focusing on maintainability and readability.
- **Input Handling**: Captures and validates user input to ensure the game's logical flow and rules are followed.
- **Game Logic**: Implements core Tic-Tac-Toe rules, including win conditions and turn management.

## Learning Outcomes
- Developed foundational skills in JavaScript programming.
- Gained experience in building interactive command-line applications.
- Enhanced problem-solving abilities through game logic implementation.

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
- Implement AI to allow single-player mode against a computer opponent.
- Include an option to choose board size (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).
